% --- Polarisation and choice of contrasts ----------------------------------

\subsection{Treatment of reference alleles}
\label{sec:reference_alleles}

In the model above we have set the effect of a given allele
(either the reference, major, or ancestral allele) to zero,
and assigned the effect of each other allele an independent Gaussian effect.
This, however, apparently depends on the choice of reference allele,
and so another choice would have been
to assign a separate independent Gaussian effect to \emph{every} allele.
It turns out that this is only equivalent in the biallelic case,
in the sense that there exists a transformation of parameters for one model
that produces the other model.
The situation is essentially that of choosing the contrasts for a factor
when fitting a linear model with Gaussian priors on the parameters:
the BLUPs are the same, but the posterior distributions on the parameters may not be,
because different choices of contrasts include non-equivalent priors.
We have made the allele-symmetric choice
because it is insensitive to the choice of reference allele
and because it fits more naturally in existing schemes for computing with tree sequences.

To see this, consider the (contrived) case in which we have $n$ haploid samples
genotyped at a single locus, and every sample has a distinct genotype.
If we write $Z_k$ as the effect of genotype $k$,
and $Y$ for an intercept,
then $X_k$, the trait value of sample $k$ is 
\begin{align*}
    X_k &= Y + Z_k \\
        &= Y + Z_0 + (Z_k - Z_0) .
\end{align*}
Now, the two models are:
\begin{align} \label{model1}
\begin{gathered}
    Y \sim \text{Normal}(0, \alpha) \\
    Z_k \sim \text{Normal}(0, \beta) ,
\end{gathered}
\end{align}
and
\begin{align} \label{model2}
\begin{gathered}
    Y + Z_0  \sim \text{Normal}(0, \gamma) \\
    Z_k - Z_0 \sim \text{Normal}(0, \delta) .
\end{gathered}
\end{align}
Under model \eqref{model1},
the covariance matrix of $X$ is
\begin{align*}
C_1 = \left[ \begin{array}{cccc}
    \alpha + \beta & \alpha         & \cdots &  \alpha\\
    \alpha         & \alpha + \beta & \alpha & \vdots \\
    \vdots         &   \alpha       &   \ddots     & \alpha \\
      \alpha       &       \cdots   & \alpha &  \alpha + \beta \\
\end{array} \right] .
\end{align*}
On the other hand, under model \eqref{model2},
the covariance matrix of $X$ is
\begin{align*}
C_2 = \left[ \begin{array}{cccc}
    \gamma         & \gamma         & \cdots &  \gamma \\
    \gamma         & \gamma + \delta & \gamma & \vdots \\
    \vdots         &      \gamma     &   \ddots     & \gamma \\
    \gamma         &       \cdots   & \gamma &  \gamma + \delta \\
\end{array} \right] .
\end{align*}
For $n=2$ and a given $\alpha$ and $\beta$, we can choose $\gamma$ and $\delta$ so that the two matrices are the same;
however, this is not in general possible for $n > 2$,
i.e., in the more-than-biallelic case.

One might hope that even though the two models are not equivalent for $(X_i)$,
they can be made equivalent for the centered values $(X_i - \bar X)$.
However, one can check that this is not the case:
in model \eqref{model2}, the variance of $X_0 - \bar X$ (the ancestral-allele-carrying sample)
differs from the other samples,
while under model \eqref{model1} they are the same.
To see this, compare $PC_1P$ and $PC_2P$, with $P = I - 11^T/n$.

% --- Multi-allelic geno -------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Multi-allelic loci in haploids}
\label{sec:multiallelic}

Following from the methods in the main paper, here we expand the haploid case with two alleles to multiple alleles.
%
The allele of individual $i$ at locus $l$ is $G_{i,l} \in \mathcal{A}$
for some alphabet $\mathcal{A}$,
and each allele $a$ at each locus $l$ has an additive effect $Z_{l,a}$.
%
We have this information for
$n_l$ loci,
$n_a$ distinct alleles, and
$n_i$ haploid individuals.
(Here we take the alphabet to be the same for all loci,
but this is only for convenience,
because alleles not present at a locus have no effect.)
Recall that the genetic value of individual $i$ is
$$
Z(i) = \frac{1}{p} \sum_{g=1}^p \sum_{\ell=1}^{n_\ell} Z_{\ell,G_{i,\ell,g}} ,
$$
where each allele $a$ at each locus $\ell$ has an independent effect
$Z_{\ell,a}$, with mean 0 and variance $\sigma^2$.
However, this might seem not very well defined,
since addition of invariant sites affects the result.
So, suppose at each locus there is an ancestral allele 


We can define the covariance for this case using equation \eqref{eqn:cov_prob}.
%
To write this covariance as a sum over alleles,
it will be convenient to use the following lemma.

\begin{lemma} \label{thm:equiv}
Let $a, b, c, d \in \{0,1\}$, and let $[a=b] = 1$ if $a=b$ and $[a=b] = 0$ otherwise.
%
Then we have:
\begin{align}
    2(a-c)(b-d) = [a=b] - [b=c] - [a=d] + [c=d].
\end{align}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
First, notice that both sides are equal to 0
if $a=b=c=d$ or if three agree and only one differs.
%
On the right-hand side,
this occurs because each of $a,b,c,d$ appears in two terms,
one positive and one negative.
%
Therefore, if any three agree and differ from a fourth one,
then we are left with $1 - 1 - 0 + 0 = 0$.
%
Now consider the case of two pairs.
%
If $a=b \neq c=d$, then both sides are equal to $+2$.
%
If $a=d \neq b=c$, then both sides are equal to $-2$.
%
Finally, if $a=c \neq b=d$, then both sides are 0.
\end{proof}

Now, for each $a \in \mathcal{A}$ let $X^a_{i,l} = 1$ if $G_{i,l} = a$,
and equal 0 otherwise.
%
We have the following identity between individuals $i$ and $j$:
%
\[ \sum_a [X^a_{i,l} = X^a_{j,l}] = \left(n_a - 2\right) + 2 P\left(X_i = X_j|l\right). \]
%
This identity follows from:
%
$$
\begin{aligned}
\sum_a \left[X^a_{i,l} = X^a_{j,l}\right]
    &= \sum_a \left(\P(X_i = X_j = a|l) + \P(X_i \neq a, X_j \neq a|l) \right) \\
    &= \P(X_i = X_j|l) + \sum_a ( 1 - \P(X_i = a, X_j \neq a|l) \\ 
    &~~~~~ - \P(X_i \neq a, X_j = a|l) - \P(X_i = X_j = a|l) ) \\
    &= n_a - \sum_a \left( \P(X_i = a|l) - \P(X_i = X_j = a|l) \right) \\ 
    &~~~~~ - \sum_a \left( \P(X_j = a|l) - \P(X_i = X_j = a|l) \right) \\
    &= n_a - 2 + 2\P(X_i = X_j|l).
\end{aligned}
$$

Then, using Lemma \ref{thm:equiv} we can write \eqref{eqn:cov_prob} as:
%
$$
\begin{aligned}
C_{ij} 
    &=
    \sum_a \frac{1}{2}\left(\P(X_i = X_j = a) - \P(X_i = X_U = a) - \P(X_j = X_V = a) + \P(X_U = X_V = a) \right) \\
    &= \frac{1}{2n_l} \sum_{l=1}^{n_l} \sum_a
        \frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{n_i^2} \sum_{u=1}^{n_i} \sum_{v=1}^{n_i}
         \left( [X^a_{i,l} = X^a_{j,l}] - [X^a_{i,l} = X^a_{u,l}] - 
         [X^a_{j,l} = X^a_{v,l}] + [X^a_{u,l} = X^a_{v,l}] \right) \\
    &= \frac{1}{2n_l} \sum_{l=1}^{n_l} \sum_a
        \frac{1}{n_i^2} \sum_{u=1}^{n_i} \sum_{v=1}^{n_i}
         \left(X^a_{i,l} - X^a_{u,l}\right)
         \left(X^a_{j,l} - X^a_{v,l}\right). \label{eqn:compute_C} \\
    &= \frac{1}{2n_l} \sum_{l=1}^{n_l} \sum_a (X_{i,l}^a - p_l^a)(X_{j,l}^a - p_l^a)
\end{aligned}
$$
%
Note that again this expression agrees with equation \eqref{eqn:trait_cov},
after dividing the equation by $n_l$.

% --- Mixed ploidy -------------------------------------------------------

% \subsection{General ploidy}
% \peter{This section to be removed.}

% We now consider the covariance between $p$-ploid individuals,
% possibly different levels of ploidy.
% %
% Returning to the notation for trait in methods, suppose individual $i$ has
% ploidy $p_i$, then their trait genetic value is given by:
% %
% $$ 
% Z(i) = \sum_l \sum_{g=1}^{p_i} Z_{l,G_{i,l,g}}.
% $$
% %
% Let $n_g = \sum_{i=1}^{n_i} p_i$ be the total number of genome copies
% in the sample set of $n_i$ individuals.
% %
% The mean haploid value of the genome copies in individuals $1, \ldots, n_i$
% with genetic values $Z(1), \ldots, Z(n_i)$ is $\bar{Z}_g = (Z(1) + \cdots + Z(n_i))/n_g$.
% %
% If we center the value of each genome copy, then the centered trait value is given by:
% %
% \begin{align}
%   \tilde{Z}(i) &= \sum_{l} \sum_{g=1}^{p_i} \left( Z_{l,G_{i,l,g}} - \bar{Z}_g \right) \\
%                &= \sum_{l} \left( \sum_{g=1}^{p_i} Z_{l,G_{i,l,g}} - p_i\bar{Z}_g \right)
% \end{align}
% %
% Note that when $p_i = p$ for all $i$, then $n_g = n_i \times p$ and
% the above $\tilde{Z}(i)$ is equivalent to $Z(i) - \bar{Z}$.
% %
% This yields a general, including mixed, ploidy version of \eqref{eqn:trait_cov}:
% %
% \begin{align} \label{eqn:trait_cov_mixed}
%     \begin{split}
%         &\Cov\left[ \tilde{Z}(i), \tilde{Z}(j) \right]\\
%         &\qquad = \sum_l \Cov\left[ \left( \sum_{g=1}^{p_i} Z_{l,G_{i,l,g}} - p_i\bar{Z}_g \right)
%                                     \left( \sum_{g=1}^{p_j} Z_{l,G_{j,l,g}} - p_j\bar{Z}_g \right) \right]\\
%         &\qquad = \sigma^2 / 2 \sum_l \sum_a
%                                \left(n(i,l,a) - p_i\bar{n}(l,a)\right)
%                                \left(n(j,l,a) - p_j\bar{n}(l,a)\right).
%     \end{split}
% \end{align}
% %
% This general ploidy formulation opens the opportunity to compute relatedness
% between individuals of any ploidy as well as between sets of individuals
% grouped in some way, say, by population.
% %
% These sets will often vary in size, hence the need for the general ploidy formulation.

% --- Computing with tree statistics -------------------------------------

% \subsection{Computing with tree statistics}
% \label{sec:treestats}

% In summary,
% let $n_g = \sum_{i=1}^{n_i} p_i$ and
% let $\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n_g}\sum_{g=1}^{n_g} x_g$.
% %
% Let
% %
% \begin{align}
%     f_{i,j}(x_1, \ldots, x_{n_i})
%     &= \frac{1}{2} \left(x_i - p_i \bar{x} \right)
%                    \left(x_j - p_j \bar{x} \right)
% \end{align}
% %
% \todo{TODO: we have not yet clarified tree sequence terminology (node here!)}
% and for each sample node $g$ and individual $i$ let
% $w_{g,i} = 1$ if $g$ is a genome copy of individual $i$, and
% $w_{g,i} = 0$ otherwise.
% %
% Let $T$ be the unpolarised, not span normalised,
% site statistic with the summary function $f_{i,j}$ and a matrix of weights $\mathbf{W}$.
% %
% Then, $T$ is exactly equation \eqref{eqn:trait_cov_mixed} and
% the following equivalences hold:
% %
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item 
%         $T$ is equal to $\Cov\left[Z(i) - \bar{Z}, Z(j) - \bar{Z}\right]$,
%         as in equation \eqref{eqn:trait_cov}.
        
%     \item 
%         If all sites are bi-allelic,
%         and $n_l$ is the number of loci,
%         then $T/n_l = C_{i,j}$,
%         as in equation \eqref{eqn:grm}.
        
%     \item
%         $T$ has the following interpretation:
%         let $m(i ,j)$ denote the total number of pairwise allele matches
%         between the genomes of individual $i$ and of individual $j$,
%         and let $U$ and $V$ be independently chosen individuals from the set of individuals.
%         Then $T$ is the number of pairwise allele matches between $i$ and $j$
%         relative to the rest of the samples:
%         $T = \E[m(i,j) - m(i,U) - m(j,V) + m(U,V)]$,
%         as in equation \eqref{eqn:relative_allele_matches}.
        
% \end{itemize}

% To obtain covariances of the non-centered values
% (i.e., for $Z(i)$ not $Z(i) - \bar Z$),
% one uses
% \begin{align*}
%     f_{i,j}(x_1, \ldots, x_{n_i})
%     = x_i x_j ,
% \end{align*}
% with a \emph{polarised} statistic.

% \todo[inline]{TODO: $Z(\mathbf{W})_i$ notation is confusing}

% Let $\mathbf{W}$ be a $n_g \times n_i$ matrix of weights,

% --- Matrix-vector multiplications --------------------------------------

% \subsection{Matrix-vector multiplications}

% In terms of a GP kernel matrix $\mathbf{K}$ on \textit{individuals}
% (rather than haplotypes), we have:
% %
% $$
%     \mathbf{K}_{i,j} = \Cov\left[Z(i) - \bar{Z}, Z(j) - \bar{Z}\right].
% $$
% %
% Or, writing $\tilde{\mathbf{Z}} = (Z(1) - \bar{Z}, \dots, Z(n_i) - \bar{Z})$,
% then $\mathbf{K} = \Var\left[\tilde{\mathbf{Z}}\right] \equiv \Cov\left[\tilde{\mathbf{Z}}, \tilde{\mathbf{Z}}\right]$.

% Suppose we want to evaluate $\mathbf{Kb}$ for a vector $\mathbf{b}$.
% %
% We have:
% %
% $$ \mathbf{Kb} = \Cov\left[\tilde{\mathbf{Z}}, \mathbf{b}^T\tilde{\mathbf{Z}}\right] $$
% %
% So the $i^{th}$ component of $\mathbf{Kb}$ is:
% %
% \begin{align}
%     (\mathbf{Kb})_i &= \Cov\left[ Z(i) - \bar{Z}, ~\sum_{j=1}^{n_i} b_j \left(Z(j) - \bar{Z} \right) \right] \\
%                     &= \Cov\left[ Z(i) - \bar{Z}, ~\sum_{j=1}^{n_i} b_j Z(j) - \sum_{j=1}^{n_i} b_j \bar{Z} \right]
% \end{align}
% %
% Factoring out $\sum{j=1}^{n_i} b_j = B$,
% $$
%     (\mathbf{Kb})_i = B \times \Cov\left[ Z(i) - \bar{Z}, ~\sum_{j=1}^{n_i} (b_j/B) Z(j) - \bar{Z} \right],
% $$
% so $\bar{Z}$ doesn't need changing!(?)

% We also have
% $$
%     (\mathbf{Kb})_i = \sum_{j=1}^{n_i} b_j \Cov\left[ Z(i) - \bar{Z}, ~Z(j) - \bar{Z} \right] 
% $$

% Using equation \eqref{eqn:trait_cov_mixed}:
% %
% % TODO: polish
% \begin{align}
%     (\mathbf{Kb})_i
%         &= \sigma^2 / 2 \sum_{j=1}^N b_j \sum_k \sum_a
%             \left(n_k(I,a) - p_I\bar{n}(k,a)\right) \left( n_k(j, a) - p_j\bar{n}(k,a)\right) \\
%         &= \sigma^2 / 2 \sum_k \sum_a
%             \left(n_k(I,a) - p_I\bar{n}(k,a)\right) \sum_{j=1}^N b_j  \left( n_k(j, a) - p_j\bar{n}(k,a)\right) \\
%         &= \sigma^2 / 2 \sum_k \sum_a
%             \left(n_k(I,a) - p_I\bar{n}(k,a)\right) \left(\sum_{j=1}^N b_j n_k(j, a) - \bar{n}(k,a)\sum_{j=1}^N b_jp_j \right)
% \end{align}

% So, given the weight matrix above, the summary function we want is 
% %
% $$\begin{aligned}
%  f_{i,j}(x_1, \ldots, x_{n_i})
%  &= \frac{1}{2} \left(x_i - \bar{x}\sum_? W_{?,i} \right)
%                 \left(x_j - \bar{x}\sum_? W_{?,j} \right).
% \end{aligned}$$

% This is equivalent to the previous summary function, since $p_i = \sum_? \mathbf{W}_{?,i}$.

% --- Kinship matrices ----------------------------------------------------

% \subsection{Kinship matrices}

% \todo[inline]{Most of this is now in methods.tex! Should we remove this sub-section?}

% One definition of the kinship matrix between individuals $i$ and $j$ is
% that $K_{i,j}$ is equal to
% ``the probability of a match between alleles drawn at random from each of them'',
% averaged over sites and with the alleles drawn with replacement if $i=j$
% (Speed \& Balding, definition of $K_{as}$).
% % TODO: GG check this reference - upon working with methods.tex, GG checked Speed \& Balding and thought the above is K_{c0}!?
% %
% Note that the probability of a match between two randomly chosen alleles
% is equal to the number of pairwise matches divided by $p^2$,
% where $p$ is the ploidy.
% %
% To get $K_{as}(i,j)$,
% we would take the summary function $x_i x_j$ and divide by $p^2 n_?$.
% %
% Another definition of Speed \& Balding is $K_{c0}$,

% % TODO: GG check this reference and K_as vs K_c0!

% --- Polarisation -------------------------------------------------------

% \subsection{Polarisation}

% Let $S'$ denote the \emph{polarised} site statistic with
% summary function $f_{i,j}$ and weights $w$.
% %
% This is simply equation \eqref{eqn:compute_C}
% but where the sum is over all \emph{non-ancestral} alleles,
% and so is equal to:
% %
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item
%         The number of pairwise matches of \emph{non-ancestral} alleles between $i$ and $j$
%         relative to random individuals, as above.
%     \item
%         $\Cov[Z(i) - \bar{Z}, Z(j) - \bar{Z}]$
%         instead the ancestral allele has zero effect and
%         derived alleles have variance $\sigma^2 / 2$.
% \end{itemize} 

% Note in particular that if all sites are bi-allelic,
% then the two components of \eqref{eqn:trait_cov} obtained by each of the two alleles are equal
% (since $(a-c)(b-d) = ((n-a)-(n-c))((n-b)-(n-d))$),
% and so the polarised statistic is just equal to one-half of the unpolarised statistic.
