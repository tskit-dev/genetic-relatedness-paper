@article{adrion2020stdpopsim,
  abstract    = {The explosion in population genomic data demands ever more complex modes of analysis, and increasingly these analyses depend on sophisticated simulations. Re-cent advances in population genetic simulation have made it possible to simulate large and complex models, but specifying such models for a particular simulation engine remains a difficult and error-prone task. Computational genetics researchers currently re-implement simulation models independently, leading to inconsistency and duplication of effort. This situation presents a major barrier to empirical researchers seeking to use simulations for power analyses of upcoming studies or sanity checks on existing genomic data. Population genetics, as a field, also lacks standard benchmarks by which new tools for inference might be measured. Here we describe a new resource, stdpopsim, that attempts to rectify this situation. Stdpopsim is a community-driven open source project, which provides easy access to a growing catalog of published simulation models from a range of organisms and supports multiple simulation engine backends. This resource is available as a well-documented python library with a simple command-line interface. We share some examples demonstrating how stdpopsim can be used to systematically compare demographic inference methods, and we encourage a broader community of developers to contribute to this growing resource.},

  abstract = {Computational analysis of a large number of genomes requires a data structure that can represent the dataset compactly while also enabling efficient operations on variants and samples. However, encoding genetic data in existing tabular data structures and file formats has become costly and unsustainable. Here we introduce the genotype representation graph (GRG), a fully connected hierarchical data structure that losslessly encodes phased whole-genome polymorphisms. Exploiting variant-sharing across samples enables GRG to compress 200,000 UK Biobank phased human genomes to 5--26{\thinspace}gigabytes per chromosome, also enabling graph-traversal algorithms to reuse computed values in random access memory. Constructing and processing GRG files scales to a million whole genomes. Using allele frequencies and association effects as examples, we show that computation on GRG via graph traversal runs the fastest among all tested alternatives. GRG-based algorithms have the potential to increase the scalability and reduce the cost of analyzing large genomic datasets.},

@article{felsenstein1985phylogenies,
  abstract = {Comparative studies of the relationship between two phenotypes, or between a phenotype and an environment, are frequently carried out by invalid statistical methods. Most regression, correlation, and contingency table methods, including nonparametric methods, assume that the points are drawn independently from a common distribution. When species are taken from a branching phylogeny, they are manifestly nonindependent. Use of a statistical method that assumes independence will cause overstatement of the significance in hypothesis tests. Some illustrative examples of these phenomena have been given, and limitations of previous proposals of ways to correct for the nonindependence have been discussed. A method of correcting for the phylogeny has been proposed. It requires that we know both the tree topology and the branch lengths, and that we be willing to allow the characters to be modeled by Brownian motion on a linear scale. Given these conditions, the phylogeny specifies a set of contrasts among species, contrasts that are statistically independent and can be used in regression or correlation studies. The considerable barriers to making practical use of this technique have been discussed.},

  abstract = {The ancestral recombination graph (ARG) is a graph-like structure that encodes a detailed genealogical history of a set of individuals along the genome. ARGs that are accurately reconstructed from genomic data have several downstream applications, but inference from data sets comprising millions of samples and variants remains computationally challenging. We introduce Threads, a threading-based method that significantly reduces the computational costs of ARG inference while retaining high accuracy. We apply Threads to infer the ARG of 487,409 genomes from the UK Biobank using \~{}10 million high-quality imputed variants, reconstructing a detailed genealogical history of the samples while compressing the input genotype data. Additionally, we develop ARG-based imputation strategies that increase genotype imputation accuracy for ultra-rare variants (MAC <=10) from UK Biobank exome sequencing data by 5-10\%. We leverage ARGs inferred by Threads to detect associations with 52 quantitative traits in non-European UK Biobank samples, identifying 22.5\% more signals than ARG-Needle. These analyses underscore the value of using computationally efficient genealogical modeling to improve and complement genotype imputation in large-scale genomic studies.Competing Interest StatementA.F.G. is an employee of deCODE genetics/Amgen; B.C.Z. is an employee of Adaptive Biotechnologies.},

@article{ralph2019empirical,
  abstract = {Inference with population genetic data usually treats the population pedigree as a nuisance parameter, the unobserved product of a past history of random mating. However, the history of genetic relationships in a given population is a fixed, unobserved object, and so an alternative approach is to treat this network of relationships as a complex object we wish to learn about, by observing how genomes have been noisily passed down through it. This paper explores this point of view, showing how to translate questions about population genetic data into calculations with a Poisson process of mutations on all ancestral genomes. This method is applied to give a robust interpretation to the f4 statistic used to identify admixture, and to design a new statistic that measures covariances in mean times to most recent common ancestor between two pairs of sequences. The method more generally interprets population genetic statistics in terms of sums of specific functions over ancestral genomes, thereby providing concrete, broadly interpretable interpretations for these statistics. This provides a method for describing demographic history without simplified demographic models. More generally, it brings into focus the population pedigree, which is averaged over in model-based demographic inference.},

  abstract = {Fine-mapping aims to identify causal variants impacting complex traits. We propose PolyFun, a computationally scalable framework to improve fine-mapping accuracy by leveraging functional annotations across the entire genome—not just genome-wide-significant loci—to specify prior probabilities for fine-mapping methods such as SuSiE or FINEMAP. In simulations, PolyFun + SuSiE and PolyFun + FINEMAP were well calibrated and identified {\textgreater}20\% more variants with a posterior causal probability {\textgreater}0.95 than identified in their nonfunctionally informed counterparts. In analyses of 49 UK Biobank traits (average n = 318,000), PolyFun + SuSiE identified 3,025 fine-mapped variant–trait pairs with posterior causal probability {\textgreater}0.95, a {\textgreater}32\% improvement versus SuSiE. We used posterior mean per-SNP heritabilities from PolyFun + SuSiE to perform polygenic localization, constructing minimal sets of common SNPs causally explaining 50\% of common SNP heritability; these sets ranged in size from 28 (hair color) to 3,400 (height) to 2 million (number of children). In conclusion, PolyFun prioritizes variants for functional follow-up and provides insights into complex trait architectures.},

@article{zhu2024variance,
  abstract = {Recent algorithmic advancements have enabled the inference of genome-wide ancestral recombination graphs (ARGs) from genomic data in large cohorts. These inferred ARGs provide a detailed representation of genealogical relatedness along the genome and have been shown to complement genotype imputation in complex trait analyses by capturing the effects of unobserved genomic variants. An inferred ARG can be used to construct a genetic relatedness matrix, which can be leveraged within a linear mixed model for the analysis of complex traits. However, these analyses are computationally infeasible for large datasets. We introduce a computationally efficient approach, called ARG-RHE, to estimate narrow-sense heritability and perform region-based association testing using an ARG. ARG-RHE relies on scalable randomized algorithms to estimate variance components and assess their statistical significance, and can be applied to multiple quantitative traits in parallel. We conduct extensive simulations to verify the computational efficiency, statistical power, and robustness of this approach. We then apply it to detect associations between 21,374 genes and 52 blood-related traits, using an ARG inferred from genotype data of 337,464 individuals from the UK Biobank. In these analyses, combining ARG-based and imputation-based testing yields 8\% more gene-trait associations than using imputation alone, suggesting that inferred genome-wide genealogies may effectively complement genotype imputation in the analysis of complex traits.Competing Interest StatementA.F.G. is currently employed by deCODE genetics.},
